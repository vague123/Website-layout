	<p>The first format of anime was theatrical viewing which originally began with commercial productions in 1917.[19] Originally the animated flips were crude and required played musical components before adding sound and vocal components to the production. On July 14, 1958, Nippon Television aired Mogura no AbanchÅ«ru ("Mole's Adventure"),
	both the first televised and first color anime to debut.[20] It wasn't until the 1960s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since.Works released in a direct to video format are called "original video animation" (OVA) or "original animation video" (OAV);
	and are typically not released theatrically or televised prior to home media release.The emergence of the Internet has led some animators to distribute works online in a format called "original net anime" ONA.</p>

    The home distribution of anime releases were popularized in the 1980s with the VHS and LaserDisc formats.[22] The VHS NTSC video format used in both Japan and the United States is credited as aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990s.[22] The Laser Disc and VHS formats were transcended by the DVD format which offered the unique advantages;
     including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc.[25] The DVD format also has its drawbacks in the its usage of region coding; adopted by the industry to solve licensing, piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the DVD player.[25] The Video CD (VCD) format was popular in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but became only a minor format in the United States that was closely associated with bootleg copies.</p>
